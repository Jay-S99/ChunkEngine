# ChunkEngine
It's a project I made during my Internship. A Python-based document chunking tool for RAG pipelines, utilizing LangChain for segmentation and Milvus for vector storage.

This project implements an efficient data preprocessing pipeline designed for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Built with Python and LangChain, it handles document ingestion and intelligent chunking strategies to optimize context retrieval. The processed data is prepared for high-performance vector storage in Milvus.
